# Network science 2021

**Note**
- [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/zademn/netsci-labs/tree/master/) might have prettier math and image rendering than github

## Prerequisites 

1. Programming: OOP, being able to read and change functions to do something else.
2. Some math: Probabilities, statistics and linear algebra
3. Graph theory – data structures

## Split  
Part 1. Labs 1-5 -- Traditional generative methods, community detection.  
Part 2 -- ML on graphs -- Embeddings, Classification, GNNs

## Environment
Either make an anaconda env or a venv and install the requirements (Please do this before the lab)

Some libraries: `networkx`, `karateclub`, `pytorch`, `pytorch_geometric`

## Datasets
[Stanford's Snap](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html)

## TODO 
Stuff that I need to finish (not exhaustive)
- [ ] Add some real world intuition
- [x] Finish probabilities recap
- [x] Add markov chains to probabilities recap
- [ ] Random walk with stochastic matrices
