# Network science 2021

## Prerequisites 

1. Programming: OOP, being able to read and change functions to do something else.
2. Some math: Probabilities, statistics and linear algebra
3. Graph theory – data structures

## Split  
Part 1. Labs 1-5 -- Traditional generative methods, community detection.  
Part 2 -- ML on graphs -- Embeddings

## Environment
Either make an anaconda env or a venv and install the requirements (Please do this before the lab)

Some libraries: `networkx`, `karateclub`, `pytorch`, `pytorch_geometric`

## Datasets
