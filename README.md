# Network science 2021

**Note**
- [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/zademn/netsci-labs/tree/master/) might have prettier math and image rendering than github
- Photos are taken from the resources (most of them from cs224w and Graph representation learning – William hamilton 2020) or the extra resources linked in the notebooks.

## Prerequisites 

1. Programming: OOP, being able to read and change functions to do something else.
2. Some math: Probabilities, statistics and linear algebra
3. Graph theory – data structures

## Split  
Part 1. Labs 1-5 -- Traditional generative methods, community detection.  
Part 2 -- ML on graphs -- Embeddings, Classification, GNNs

## Environment
Either make an anaconda env or a venv and install the requirements (Please do this before the lab)

Some of the used libraries: `networkx`, `karateclub`, `pytorch`, `pytorch_geometric`
